# Modifying an OS Without The Source Part 1 - The Easy Part

## Introduction

Several years ago, at a previous company I worked for, I was a member of a platform
team that, among other things, owned several FreeBSD and CentOS builds. When the 
team was founded, this was a manageable one OpenBSD and one CentOS image. However,
as the team and the amount of projects grew, this number quickly ballooned to two
OS builds per engineer.

To make matters worse, the team was not stocked with OS experts: most of the work
day to day was best described as backend web development, so most of these OS builds
were frozen in time

To make matters even worse, the oldest OS builds were greater than 5 years old, meaning
the knowledge of how they worked left with the engineers.
